ON THE great passenger steamer, due to depart New York for Buenos Aires at midnight, there was the usual last-minute bustle and commotion.Visitors from shore shoved confusedly to see their friends off,telegraph boys in cocked caps dashed through the lounges shouting names, trunks and flowers were carriedpast, and inquisitive children ran up and down the companionways, the orchestra playing imperturbably on deck all the while. As I was standing a bit apart from this hubbub, talking on the promenade deck with anacquaintance of mine, two or three flashbulbs flared near us — apparently the press had been quicklyinterviewing and photographing some celebrity just before we sailed. My friend glanced over and smiled.“That’s a rare bird you’ve got on board — that’s Czentovic.” I must have received this news with a ratherblank look, for he went on to explain, “Mirko Czentovic, the world chess champion. He’s crisscrossedAmerica from coast to coast playing tournaments and is now off to Argentina for fresh triumphs.”In fact I now recalled this young world champion and even some details of his meteoric career; my friend, amore assiduous reader of newspapers than I, was able to add a number of anecdotes. About a yearpreviously Czentovic had overnight entered the ranks of the greatest masters of the art of chess, such asAlekhine, Capablanca, Tartakower, Lasker, and Bogoljubov. Not since the appearance of the seven-year-oldprodigy Reshevsky at the New York chess tournament of 1922 had the penetration of a complete unknowninto that circle of luminaries caused such a wide sensation. For Czentovic’s intellectual traits certainly didnot seem to promise a dazzling career. It soon emerged that, chess champion or not, in private Czentovicwas unable to write a correctly spelled sentence in any language, and, as one of his irritated peers gibed,“his ignorance was just as absolute in everyother area.”Czentovic’s father, a penniless Yugoslavian Danube bargeman, had been killed in his tiny boat when it wascrushed one night by a grain steamer in a remote area; the twelve-year-old boy had then been taken in bythe local parson out of pity. The good reverend coached him at home, doing his level best to make up forwhat the lumpish, taciturn, broad-browed boy was unable to learn at the village school.But the parson’s efforts were in vain. The letters of the alphabet had been explained to the boy a hundredtimes, yet still he stared at them as though he had never seen them before; no matter how simple thesubject, his brain labored heavily but retained nothing. At the age of fourteen he still counted on his fingers,and, though he was now an adolescent, he could read books and newspapers only with great difficulty. YetMirko could not be called reluctant or willful. He obediently did what was asked, carried water, split wood,helped in the fields, cleaned the kitchen, and reliably (though with annoying slowness) finished any task hewas given. But what irritated the good parson most about the awkward boy was his total apathy. He didnothing unless specifically told to, never asked a question, did not play with other boys, and undertook noactivity that had not been explicitly assigned to him; once Mirko had finished his chores, he sat aroundlistlessly indoors with the vacant look of sheep at pasture, taking not the slightest interest in what went onaround him. While the parson, puffing on his long peasant pipe, played his usual three evening games ofchess with the local constable, the lank-haired blond boy squatted silently beside them and gazed at thecheckered board from beneath his heavy eyelids, seemingly somnolent and indifferent.ON THE great passenger steamer, due to depart New York for Buenos Aires at midnight, there was the usual last-minute bustle and commotion.Visitors from shore shoved confusedly to see their friends off,telegraph boys in cocked caps dashed through the lounges shouting names, trunks and flowers were carriedpast, and inquisitive children ran up and down the companionways, the orchestra playing imperturbably on deck all the while.

He didnothing unless specifically told to, never asked a question, did not play with other boys, and undertook noactivity that had not been explicitly assigned to him; once Mirko had finished his chores, he sat aroundlistlessly indoors with the vacant look of sheep at pasture, taking not the slightest interest in what went onaround him. While the parson, puffing on his long peasant pipe, played his usual three evening games ofchess with the local constable, the lank-haired blond boy squatted silently beside them and gazed at thecheckered board from beneath his heavy eyelids, seemingly somnolent and indifferent.ON THE great passenger steamer, due to depart New York for Buenos Aires at midnight, there was the usual last-minute bustle and commotion.Visitors from shore shoved confusedly to see their friends off,telegraph boys in cocked caps dashed through the lounges shouting names, trunks and flowers were carriedpast, and inquisitive children ran up and down the companionways, the orchestra playing imperturbably on deck all the while. As I was standing a bit apart from this hubbub, talking on the promenade deck with anacquaintance of mine, two or three flashbulbs flared near us — apparently the press had been quicklyinterviewing and photographing some celebrity just before we sailed. My friend glanced over and smiled.“That’s a rare bird you’ve got on board — that’s Czentovic.” I must have received this news with a ratherblank look, for he went on to explain, “Mirko Czentovic, the world chess champion. He’s crisscrossedAmerica from coast to coast playing tournaments and is now off to Argentina for fresh triumphs.”In fact I now recalled this young world champion and even some details of his meteoric career; my friend, amore assiduous reader of newspapers than I, was able to add a number of anecdotes. About a yearpreviously Czentovic had overnight entered the ranks of the greatest masters of the art of chess, such asAlekhine, Capablanca, Tartakower, Lasker, and Bogoljubov. Not since the appearance of the seven-year-oldprodigy Reshevsky at the New York chess tournament of 1922 had the penetration of a complete unknowninto that circle of luminaries caused such a wide sensation. For Czentovic’s intellectual traits certainly didnot seem to promise a dazzling career. It soon emerged that, chess champion or not, in private Czentovicwas unable to write a correctly spelled sentence in any language, and, as one of his irritated peers gibed,“his ignorance was just as absolute in everyother area.”Czentovic’s father, a penniless Yugoslavian Danube bargeman, had been killed in his tiny boat when it wascrushed one night by a grain steamer in a remote area; the twelve-year-old boy had then been taken in bythe local parson out of pity. The good reverend coached him at home, doing his level best to make up forwhat the lumpish, taciturn, broad-browed boy was unable to learn at the village school.But the parson’s efforts were in vain. The letters of the alphabet had been explained to the boy a hundredtimes, yet still he stared at them as though he had never seen them before; no matter how simple thesubject, his brain labored heavily but retained nothing. At the age of fourteen he still counted on his fingers,and, though he was now an adolescent, he could read books and newspapers only with great difficulty. YetMirko could not be called reluctant or willful. He obediently did what was asked, carried water, split wood,helped in the fields, cleaned the kitchen, and reliably (though with annoying slowness) finished any task hewas given.

The letters of the alphabet had been explained to the boy a hundredtimes, yet still he stared at them as though he had never seen them before; no matter how simple thesubject, his brain labored heavily but retained nothing. At the age of fourteen he still counted on his fingers,and, though he was now an adolescent, he could read books and newspapers only with great difficulty. YetMirko could not be called reluctant or willful. He obediently did what was asked, carried water, split wood,helped in the fields, cleaned the kitchen, and reliably (though with annoying slowness) finished any task hewas given. But what irritated the good parson most about the awkward boy was his total apathy. He didnothing unless specifically told to, never asked a question, did not play with other boys, and undertook noactivity that had not been explicitly assigned to him; once Mirko had finished his chores, he sat aroundlistlessly indoors with the vacant look of sheep at pasture, taking not the slightest interest in what went onaround him. While the parson, puffing on his long peasant pipe, played his usual three evening games ofchess with the local constable, the lank-haired blond boy squatted silently beside them and gazed at thecheckered board from beneath his heavy eyelids, seemingly somnolent and indifferent.ON THE great passenger steamer, due to depart New York for Buenos Aires at midnight, there was the usual last-minute bustle and commotion.Visitors from shore shoved confusedly to see their friends off,telegraph boys in cocked caps dashed through the lounges shouting names, trunks and flowers were carriedpast, and inquisitive children ran up and down the companionways, the orchestra playing imperturbably on deck all the while. As I was standing a bit apart from this hubbub, talking on the promenade deck with anacquaintance of mine, two or three flashbulbs flared near us — apparently the press had been quicklyinterviewing and photographing some celebrity just before we sailed. My friend glanced over and smiled.“That’s a rare bird you’ve got on board — that’s Czentovic.” I must have received this news with a ratherblank look, for he went on to explain, “Mirko Czentovic, the world chess champion. He’s crisscrossedAmerica from coast to coast playing tournaments and is now off to Argentina for fresh triumphs.”In fact I now recalled this young world champion and even some details of his meteoric career; my friend, amore assiduous reader of newspapers than I, was able to add a number of anecdotes. About a yearpreviously Czentovic had overnight entered the ranks of the greatest masters of the art of chess, such asAlekhine, Capablanca, Tartakower, Lasker, and Bogoljubov. Not since the appearance of the seven-year-oldprodigy Reshevsky at the New York chess tournament of 1922 had the penetration of a complete unknowninto that circle of luminaries caused such a wide sensation. For Czentovic’s intellectual traits certainly didnot seem to promise a dazzling career.

Not since the appearance of the seven-year-oldprodigy Reshevsky at the New York chess tournament of 1922 had the penetration of a complete unknowninto that circle of luminaries caused such a wide sensation. For Czentovic’s intellectual traits certainly didnot seem to promise a dazzling career. It soon emerged that, chess champion or not, in private Czentovicwas unable to write a correctly spelled sentence in any language, and, as one of his irritated peers gibed,“his ignorance was just as absolute in everyother area.”Czentovic’s father, a penniless Yugoslavian Danube bargeman, had been killed in his tiny boat when it wascrushed one night by a grain steamer in a remote area; the twelve-year-old boy had then been taken in bythe local parson out of pity. The good reverend coached him at home, doing his level best to make up forwhat the lumpish, taciturn, broad-browed boy was unable to learn at the village school.But the parson’s efforts were in vain. The letters of the alphabet had been explained to the boy a hundredtimes, yet still he stared at them as though he had never seen them before; no matter how simple thesubject, his brain labored heavily but retained nothing. At the age of fourteen he still counted on his fingers,and, though he was now an adolescent, he could read books and newspapers only with great difficulty. YetMirko could not be called reluctant or willful. He obediently did what was asked, carried water, split wood,helped in the fields, cleaned the kitchen, and reliably (though with annoying slowness) finished any task hewas given. But what irritated the good parson most about the awkward boy was his total apathy. He didnothing unless specifically told to, never asked a question, did not play with other boys, and undertook noactivity that had not been explicitly assigned to him; once Mirko had finished his chores, he sat aroundlistlessly indoors with the vacant look of sheep at pasture, taking not the slightest interest in what went onaround him. While the parson, puffing on his long peasant pipe, played his usual three evening games ofchess with the local constable, the lank-haired blond boy squatted silently beside them and gazed at thecheckered board from beneath his heavy eyelids, seemingly somnolent and indifferent.ON THE great passenger steamer, due to depart New York for Buenos Aires at midnight, there was the usual last-minute bustle and commotion.Visitors from shore shoved confusedly to see their friends off,telegraph boys in cocked caps dashed through the lounges shouting names, trunks and flowers were carriedpast, and inquisitive children ran up and down the companionways, the orchestra playing imperturbably on deck all the while. As I was standing a bit apart from this hubbub, talking on the promenade deck with anacquaintance of mine, two or three flashbulbs flared near us — apparently the press had been quicklyinterviewing and photographing some celebrity just before we sailed. My friend glanced over and smiled.“That’s a rare bird you’ve got on board — that’s Czentovic.” I must have received this news with a ratherblank look, for he went on to explain, “Mirko Czentovic, the world chess champion.

My friend glanced over and smiled.“That’s a rare bird you’ve got on board — that’s Czentovic.” I must have received this news with a ratherblank look, for he went on to explain, “Mirko Czentovic, the world chess champion. He’s crisscrossedAmerica from coast to coast playing tournaments and is now off to Argentina for fresh triumphs.”In fact I now recalled this young world champion and even some details of his meteoric career; my friend, amore assiduous reader of newspapers than I, was able to add a number of anecdotes. About a yearpreviously Czentovic had overnight entered the ranks of the greatest masters of the art of chess, such asAlekhine, Capablanca, Tartakower, Lasker, and Bogoljubov. Not since the appearance of the seven-year-oldprodigy Reshevsky at the New York chess tournament of 1922 had the penetration of a complete unknowninto that circle of luminaries caused such a wide sensation. For Czentovic’s intellectual traits certainly didnot seem to promise a dazzling career. It soon emerged that, chess champion or not, in private Czentovicwas unable to write a correctly spelled sentence in any language, and, as one of his irritated peers gibed,“his ignorance was just as absolute in everyother area.”Czentovic’s father, a penniless Yugoslavian Danube bargeman, had been killed in his tiny boat when it wascrushed one night by a grain steamer in a remote area; the twelve-year-old boy had then been taken in bythe local parson out of pity. The good reverend coached him at home, doing his level best to make up forwhat the lumpish, taciturn, broad-browed boy was unable to learn at the village school.But the parson’s efforts were in vain. The letters of the alphabet had been explained to the boy a hundredtimes, yet still he stared at them as though he had never seen them before; no matter how simple thesubject, his brain labored heavily but retained nothing. At the age of fourteen he still counted on his fingers,and, though he was now an adolescent, he could read books and newspapers only with great difficulty. YetMirko could not be called reluctant or willful. He obediently did what was asked, carried water, split wood,helped in the fields, cleaned the kitchen, and reliably (though with annoying slowness) finished any task hewas given. But what irritated the good parson most about the awkward boy was his total apathy. He didnothing unless specifically told to, never asked a question, did not play with other boys, and undertook noactivity that had not been explicitly assigned to him; once Mirko had finished his chores, he sat aroundlistlessly indoors with the vacant look of sheep at pasture, taking not the slightest interest in what went onaround him.

He didnothing unless specifically told to, never asked a question, did not play with other boys, and undertook noactivity that had not been explicitly assigned to him; once Mirko had finished his chores, he sat aroundlistlessly indoors with the vacant look of sheep at pasture, taking not the slightest interest in what went onaround him. While the parson, puffing on his long peasant pipe, played his usual three evening games ofchess with the local constable, the lank-haired blond boy squatted silently beside them and gazed at thecheckered board from beneath his heavy eyelids, seemingly somnolent and indifferent.ON THE great passenger steamer, due to depart New York for Buenos Aires at midnight, there was the usual last-minute bustle and commotion.Visitors from shore shoved confusedly to see their friends off,telegraph boys in cocked caps dashed through the lounges shouting names, trunks and flowers were carriedpast, and inquisitive children ran up and down the companionways, the orchestra playing imperturbably on deck all the while. As I was standing a bit apart from this hubbub, talking on the promenade deck with anacquaintance of mine, two or three flashbulbs flared near us — apparently the press had been quicklyinterviewing and photographing some celebrity just before we sailed. My friend glanced over and smiled.“That’s a rare bird you’ve got on board — that’s Czentovic.” I must have received this news with a ratherblank look, for he went on to explain, “Mirko Czentovic, the world chess champion. He’s crisscrossedAmerica from coast to coast playing tournaments and is now off to Argentina for fresh triumphs.”In fact I now recalled this young world champion and even some details of his meteoric career; my friend, amore assiduous reader of newspapers than I, was able to add a number of anecdotes. About a yearpreviously Czentovic had overnight entered the ranks of the greatest masters of the art of chess, such asAlekhine, Capablanca, Tartakower, Lasker, and Bogoljubov. Not since the appearance of the seven-year-oldprodigy Reshevsky at the New York chess tournament of 1922 had the penetration of a complete unknowninto that circle of luminaries caused such a wide sensation. For Czentovic’s intellectual traits certainly didnot seem to promise a dazzling career. It soon emerged that, chess champion or not, in private Czentovicwas unable to write a correctly spelled sentence in any language, and, as one of his irritated peers gibed,“his ignorance was just as absolute in everyother area.”Czentovic’s father, a penniless Yugoslavian Danube bargeman, had been killed in his tiny boat when it wascrushed one night by a grain steamer in a remote area; the twelve-year-old boy had then been taken in bythe local parson out of pity. The good reverend coached him at home, doing his level best to make up forwhat the lumpish, taciturn, broad-browed boy was unable to learn at the village school.But the parson’s efforts were in vain. The letters of the alphabet had been explained to the boy a hundredtimes, yet still he stared at them as though he had never seen them before; no matter how simple thesubject, his brain labored heavily but retained nothing. At the age of fourteen he still counted on his fingers,and, though he was now an adolescent, he could read books and newspapers only with great difficulty. YetMirko could not be called reluctant or willful. He obediently did what was asked, carried water, split wood,helped in the fields, cleaned the kitchen, and reliably (though with annoying slowness) finished any task hewas given.

The letters of the alphabet had been explained to the boy a hundredtimes, yet still he stared at them as though he had never seen them before; no matter how simple thesubject, his brain labored heavily but retained nothing. At the age of fourteen he still counted on his fingers,and, though he was now an adolescent, he could read books and newspapers only with great difficulty. YetMirko could not be called reluctant or willful. He obediently did what was asked, carried water, split wood,helped in the fields, cleaned the kitchen, and reliably (though with annoying slowness) finished any task hewas given. But what irritated the good parson most about the awkward boy was his total apathy. He didnothing unless specifically told to, never asked a question, did not play with other boys, and undertook noactivity that had not been explicitly assigned to him; once Mirko had finished his chores, he sat aroundlistlessly indoors with the vacant look of sheep at pasture, taking not the slightest interest in what went onaround him. While the parson, puffing on his long peasant pipe, played his usual three evening games ofchess with the local constable, the lank-haired blond boy squatted silently beside them and gazed at thecheckered board from beneath his heavy eyelids, seemingly somnolent and indifferent.ON THE great passenger steamer, due to depart New York for Buenos Aires at midnight, there was the usual last-minute bustle and commotion.Visitors from shore shoved confusedly to see their friends off,telegraph boys in cocked caps dashed through the lounges shouting names, trunks and flowers were carriedpast, and inquisitive children ran up and down the companionways, the orchestra playing imperturbably on deck all the while. As I was standing a bit apart from this hubbub, talking on the promenade deck with anacquaintance of mine, two or three flashbulbs flared near us — apparently the press had been quicklyinterviewing and photographing some celebrity just before we sailed. My friend glanced over and smiled.“That’s a rare bird you’ve got on board — that’s Czentovic.” I must have received this news with a ratherblank look, for he went on to explain, “Mirko Czentovic, the world chess champion. He’s crisscrossedAmerica from coast to coast playing tournaments and is now off to Argentina for fresh triumphs.”In fact I now recalled this young world champion and even some details of his meteoric career; my friend, amore assiduous reader of newspapers than I, was able to add a number of anecdotes. About a yearpreviously Czentovic had overnight entered the ranks of the greatest masters of the art of chess, such asAlekhine, Capablanca, Tartakower, Lasker, and Bogoljubov. Not since the appearance of the seven-year-oldprodigy Reshevsky at the New York chess tournament of 1922 had the penetration of a complete unknowninto that circle of luminaries caused such a wide sensation. For Czentovic’s intellectual traits certainly didnot seem to promise a dazzling career.

Not since the appearance of the seven-year-oldprodigy Reshevsky at the New York chess tournament of 1922 had the penetration of a complete unknowninto that circle of luminaries caused such a wide sensation. For Czentovic’s intellectual traits certainly didnot seem to promise a dazzling career. It soon emerged that, chess champion or not, in private Czentovicwas unable to write a correctly spelled sentence in any language, and, as one of his irritated peers gibed,“his ignorance was just as absolute in everyother area.”Czentovic’s father, a penniless Yugoslavian Danube bargeman, had been killed in his tiny boat when it wascrushed one night by a grain steamer in a remote area; the twelve-year-old boy had then been taken in bythe local parson out of pity. The good reverend coached him at home, doing his level best to make up forwhat the lumpish, taciturn, broad-browed boy was unable to learn at the village school.But the parson’s efforts were in vain. The letters of the alphabet had been explained to the boy a hundredtimes, yet still he stared at them as though he had never seen them before; no matter how simple thesubject, his brain labored heavily but retained nothing. At the age of fourteen he still counted on his fingers,and, though he was now an adolescent, he could read books and newspapers only with great difficulty. YetMirko could not be called reluctant or willful. He obediently did what was asked, carried water, split wood,helped in the fields, cleaned the kitchen, and reliably (though with annoying slowness) finished any task hewas given. But what irritated the good parson most about the awkward boy was his total apathy. He didnothing unless specifically told to, never asked a question, did not play with other boys, and undertook noactivity that had not been explicitly assigned to him; once Mirko had finished his chores, he sat aroundlistlessly indoors with the vacant look of sheep at pasture, taking not the slightest interest in what went onaround him. While the parson, puffing on his long peasant pipe, played his usual three evening games ofchess with the local constable, the lank-haired blond boy squatted silently beside them and gazed at thecheckered board from beneath his heavy eyelids, seemingly somnolent and indifferent.ON THE great passenger steamer, due to depart New York for Buenos Aires at midnight, there was the usual last-minute bustle and commotion.Visitors from shore shoved confusedly to see their friends off,telegraph boys in cocked caps dashed through the lounges shouting names, trunks and flowers were carriedpast, and inquisitive children ran up and down the companionways, the orchestra playing imperturbably on deck all the while. As I was standing a bit apart from this hubbub, talking on the promenade deck with anacquaintance of mine, two or three flashbulbs flared near us — apparently the press had been quicklyinterviewing and photographing some celebrity just before we sailed. My friend glanced over and smiled.“That’s a rare bird you’ve got on board — that’s Czentovic.” I must have received this news with a ratherblank look, for he went on to explain, “Mirko Czentovic, the world chess champion.

My friend glanced over and smiled.“That’s a rare bird you’ve got on board — that’s Czentovic.” I must have received this news with a ratherblank look, for he went on to explain, “Mirko Czentovic, the world chess champion. He’s crisscrossedAmerica from coast to coast playing tournaments and is now off to Argentina for fresh triumphs.”In fact I now recalled this young world champion and even some details of his meteoric career; my friend, amore assiduous reader of newspapers than I, was able to add a number of anecdotes. About a yearpreviously Czentovic had overnight entered the ranks of the greatest masters of the art of chess, such asAlekhine, Capablanca, Tartakower, Lasker, and Bogoljubov. Not since the appearance of the seven-year-oldprodigy Reshevsky at the New York chess tournament of 1922 had the penetration of a complete unknowninto that circle of luminaries caused such a wide sensation. For Czentovic’s intellectual traits certainly didnot seem to promise a dazzling career. It soon emerged that, chess champion or not, in private Czentovicwas unable to write a correctly spelled sentence in any language, and, as one of his irritated peers gibed,“his ignorance was just as absolute in everyother area.”Czentovic’s father, a penniless Yugoslavian Danube bargeman, had been killed in his tiny boat when it wascrushed one night by a grain steamer in a remote area; the twelve-year-old boy had then been taken in bythe local parson out of pity. The good reverend coached him at home, doing his level best to make up forwhat the lumpish, taciturn, broad-browed boy was unable to learn at the village school.But the parson’s efforts were in vain. The letters of the alphabet had been explained to the boy a hundredtimes, yet still he stared at them as though he had never seen them before; no matter how simple thesubject, his brain labored heavily but retained nothing. At the age of fourteen he still counted on his fingers,and, though he was now an adolescent, he could read books and newspapers only with great difficulty. YetMirko could not be called reluctant or willful. He obediently did what was asked, carried water, split wood,helped in the fields, cleaned the kitchen, and reliably (though with annoying slowness) finished any task hewas given. But what irritated the good parson most about the awkward boy was his total apathy. He didnothing unless specifically told to, never asked a question, did not play with other boys, and undertook noactivity that had not been explicitly assigned to him; once Mirko had finished his chores, he sat aroundlistlessly indoors with the vacant look of sheep at pasture, taking not the slightest interest in what went onaround him.

He didnothing unless specifically told to, never asked a question, did not play with other boys, and undertook noactivity that had not been explicitly assigned to him; once Mirko had finished his chores, he sat aroundlistlessly indoors with the vacant look of sheep at pasture, taking not the slightest interest in what went onaround him. While the parson, puffing on his long peasant pipe, played his usual three evening games ofchess with the local constable, the lank-haired blond boy squatted silently beside them and gazed at thecheckered board from beneath his heavy eyelids, seemingly somnolent and indifferent.ON THE great passenger steamer, due to depart New York for Buenos Aires at midnight, there was the usual last-minute bustle and commotion.Visitors from shore shoved confusedly to see their friends off,telegraph boys in cocked caps dashed through the lounges shouting names, trunks and flowers were carriedpast, and inquisitive children ran up and down the companionways, the orchestra playing imperturbably on deck all the while. As I was standing a bit apart from this hubbub, talking on the promenade deck with anacquaintance of mine, two or three flashbulbs flared near us — apparently the press had been quicklyinterviewing and photographing some celebrity just before we sailed. My friend glanced over and smiled.“That’s a rare bird you’ve got on board — that’s Czentovic.” I must have received this news with a ratherblank look, for he went on to explain, “Mirko Czentovic, the world chess champion. He’s crisscrossedAmerica from coast to coast playing tournaments and is now off to Argentina for fresh triumphs.”In fact I now recalled this young world champion and even some details of his meteoric career; my friend, amore assiduous reader of newspapers than I, was able to add a number of anecdotes. About a yearpreviously Czentovic had overnight entered the ranks of the greatest masters of the art of chess, such asAlekhine, Capablanca, Tartakower, Lasker, and Bogoljubov. Not since the appearance of the seven-year-oldprodigy Reshevsky at the New York chess tournament of 1922 had the penetration of a complete unknowninto that circle of luminaries caused such a wide sensation. For Czentovic’s intellectual traits certainly didnot seem to promise a dazzling career. It soon emerged that, chess champion or not, in private Czentovicwas unable to write a correctly spelled sentence in any language, and, as one of his irritated peers gibed,“his ignorance was just as absolute in everyother area.”Czentovic’s father, a penniless Yugoslavian Danube bargeman, had been killed in his tiny boat when it wascrushed one night by a grain steamer in a remote area; the twelve-year-old boy had then been taken in bythe local parson out of pity. The good reverend coached him at home, doing his level best to make up forwhat the lumpish, taciturn, broad-browed boy was unable to learn at the village school.But the parson’s efforts were in vain. The letters of the alphabet had been explained to the boy a hundredtimes, yet still he stared at them as though he had never seen them before; no matter how simple thesubject, his brain labored heavily but retained nothing. At the age of fourteen he still counted on his fingers,and, though he was now an adolescent, he could read books and newspapers only with great difficulty. YetMirko could not be called reluctant or willful. He obediently did what was asked, carried water, split wood,helped in the fields, cleaned the kitchen, and reliably (though with annoying slowness) finished any task hewas given.

The letters of the alphabet had been explained to the boy a hundredtimes, yet still he stared at them as though he had never seen them before; no matter how simple thesubject, his brain labored heavily but retained nothing. At the age of fourteen he still counted on his fingers,and, though he was now an adolescent, he could read books and newspapers only with great difficulty. YetMirko could not be called reluctant or willful. He obediently did what was asked, carried water, split wood,helped in the fields, cleaned the kitchen, and reliably (though with annoying slowness) finished any task hewas given. But what irritated the good parson most about the awkward boy was his total apathy. He didnothing unless specifically told to, never asked a question, did not play with other boys, and undertook noactivity that had not been explicitly assigned to him; once Mirko had finished his chores, he sat aroundlistlessly indoors with the vacant look of sheep at pasture, taking not the slightest interest in what went onaround him. While the parson, puffing on his long peasant pipe, played his usual three evening games ofchess with the local constable, the lank-haired blond boy squatted silently beside them and gazed at thecheckered board from beneath his heavy eyelids, seemingly somnolent and indifferent.ON THE great passenger steamer, due to depart New York for Buenos Aires at midnight, there was the usual last-minute bustle and commotion.Visitors from shore shoved confusedly to see their friends off,telegraph boys in cocked caps dashed through the lounges shouting names, trunks and flowers were carriedpast, and inquisitive children ran up and down the companionways, the orchestra playing imperturbably on deck all the while. As I was standing a bit apart from this hubbub, talking on the promenade deck with anacquaintance of mine, two or three flashbulbs flared near us — apparently the press had been quicklyinterviewing and photographing some celebrity just before we sailed. My friend glanced over and smiled.“That’s a rare bird you’ve got on board — that’s Czentovic.” I must have received this news with a ratherblank look, for he went on to explain, “Mirko Czentovic, the world chess champion. He’s crisscrossedAmerica from coast to coast playing tournaments and is now off to Argentina for fresh triumphs.”In fact I now recalled this young world champion and even some details of his meteoric career; my friend, amore assiduous reader of newspapers than I, was able to add a number of anecdotes. About a yearpreviously Czentovic had overnight entered the ranks of the greatest masters of the art of chess, such asAlekhine, Capablanca, Tartakower, Lasker, and Bogoljubov. Not since the appearance of the seven-year-oldprodigy Reshevsky at the New York chess tournament of 1922 had the penetration of a complete unknowninto that circle of luminaries caused such a wide sensation. For Czentovic’s intellectual traits certainly didnot seem to promise a dazzling career.

Not since the appearance of the seven-year-oldprodigy Reshevsky at the New York chess tournament of 1922 had the penetration of a complete unknowninto that circle of luminaries caused such a wide sensation. For Czentovic’s intellectual traits certainly didnot seem to promise a dazzling career. It soon emerged that, chess champion or not, in private Czentovicwas unable to write a correctly spelled sentence in any language, and, as one of his irritated peers gibed,“his ignorance was just as absolute in everyother area.”Czentovic’s father, a penniless Yugoslavian Danube bargeman, had been killed in his tiny boat when it wascrushed one night by a grain steamer in a remote area; the twelve-year-old boy had then been taken in bythe local parson out of pity. The good reverend coached him at home, doing his level best to make up forwhat the lumpish, taciturn, broad-browed boy was unable to learn at the village school.But the parson’s efforts were in vain. The letters of the alphabet had been explained to the boy a hundredtimes, yet still he stared at them as though he had never seen them before; no matter how simple thesubject, his brain labored heavily but retained nothing. At the age of fourteen he still counted on his fingers,and, though he was now an adolescent, he could read books and newspapers only with great difficulty. YetMirko could not be called reluctant or willful. He obediently did what was asked, carried water, split wood,helped in the fields, cleaned the kitchen, and reliably (though with annoying slowness) finished any task hewas given. But what irritated the good parson most about the awkward boy was his total apathy. He didnothing unless specifically told to, never asked a question, did not play with other boys, and undertook noactivity that had not been explicitly assigned to him; once Mirko had finished his chores, he sat aroundlistlessly indoors with the vacant look of sheep at pasture, taking not the slightest interest in what went onaround him. While the parson, puffing on his long peasant pipe, played his usual three evening games ofchess with the local constable, the lank-haired blond boy squatted silently beside them and gazed at thecheckered board from beneath his heavy eyelids, seemingly somnolent and indifferent.ON THE great passenger steamer, due to depart New York for Buenos Aires at midnight, there was the usual last-minute bustle and commotion.Visitors from shore shoved confusedly to see their friends off,telegraph boys in cocked caps dashed through the lounges shouting names, trunks and flowers were carriedpast, and inquisitive children ran up and down the companionways, the orchestra playing imperturbably on deck all the while. As I was standing a bit apart from this hubbub, talking on the promenade deck with anacquaintance of mine, two or three flashbulbs flared near us — apparently the press had been quicklyinterviewing and photographing some celebrity just before we sailed. My friend glanced over and smiled.“That’s a rare bird you’ve got on board — that’s Czentovic.” I must have received this news with a ratherblank look, for he went on to explain, “Mirko Czentovic, the world chess champion.

My friend glanced over and smiled.“That’s a rare bird you’ve got on board — that’s Czentovic.” I must have received this news with a ratherblank look, for he went on to explain, “Mirko Czentovic, the world chess champion. He’s crisscrossedAmerica from coast to coast playing tournaments and is now off to Argentina for fresh triumphs.”In fact I now recalled this young world champion and even some details of his meteoric career; my friend, amore assiduous reader of newspapers than I, was able to add a number of anecdotes. About a yearpreviously Czentovic had overnight entered the ranks of the greatest masters of the art of chess, such asAlekhine, Capablanca, Tartakower, Lasker, and Bogoljubov. Not since the appearance of the seven-year-oldprodigy Reshevsky at the New York chess tournament of 1922 had the penetration of a complete unknowninto that circle of luminaries caused such a wide sensation. For Czentovic’s intellectual traits certainly didnot seem to promise a dazzling career. It soon emerged that, chess champion or not, in private Czentovicwas unable to write a correctly spelled sentence in any language, and, as one of his irritated peers gibed,“his ignorance was just as absolute in everyother area.”Czentovic’s father, a penniless Yugoslavian Danube bargeman, had been killed in his tiny boat when it wascrushed one night by a grain steamer in a remote area; the twelve-year-old boy had then been taken in bythe local parson out of pity. The good reverend coached him at home, doing his level best to make up forwhat the lumpish, taciturn, broad-browed boy was unable to learn at the village school.But the parson’s efforts were in vain. The letters of the alphabet had been explained to the boy a hundredtimes, yet still he stared at them as though he had never seen them before; no matter how simple thesubject, his brain labored heavily but retained nothing. At the age of fourteen he still counted on his fingers,and, though he was now an adolescent, he could read books and newspapers only with great difficulty. YetMirko could not be called reluctant or willful. He obediently did what was asked, carried water, split wood,helped in the fields, cleaned the kitchen, and reliably (though with annoying slowness) finished any task hewas given. But what irritated the good parson most about the awkward boy was his total apathy. He didnothing unless specifically told to, never asked a question, did not play with other boys, and undertook noactivity that had not been explicitly assigned to him; once Mirko had finished his chores, he sat aroundlistlessly indoors with the vacant look of sheep at pasture, taking not the slightest interest in what went onaround him.

He didnothing unless specifically told to, never asked a question, did not play with other boys, and undertook noactivity that had not been explicitly assigned to him; once Mirko had finished his chores, he sat aroundlistlessly indoors with the vacant look of sheep at pasture, taking not the slightest interest in what went onaround him. While the parson, puffing on his long peasant pipe, played his usual three evening games ofchess with the local constable, the lank-haired blond boy squatted silently beside them and gazed at thecheckered board from beneath his heavy eyelids, seemingly somnolent and indifferent.ON THE great passenger steamer, due to depart New York for Buenos Aires at midnight, there was the usual last-minute bustle and commotion.Visitors from shore shoved confusedly to see their friends off,telegraph boys in cocked caps dashed through the lounges shouting names, trunks and flowers were carriedpast, and inquisitive children ran up and down the companionways, the orchestra playing imperturbably on deck all the while. As I was standing a bit apart from this hubbub, talking on the promenade deck with anacquaintance of mine, two or three flashbulbs flared near us — apparently the press had been quicklyinterviewing and photographing some celebrity just before we sailed. My friend glanced over and smiled.“That’s a rare bird you’ve got on board — that’s Czentovic.” I must have received this news with a ratherblank look, for he went on to explain, “Mirko Czentovic, the world chess champion. He’s crisscrossedAmerica from coast to coast playing tournaments and is now off to Argentina for fresh triumphs.”In fact I now recalled this young world champion and even some details of his meteoric career; my friend, amore assiduous reader of newspapers than I, was able to add a number of anecdotes. About a yearpreviously Czentovic had overnight entered the ranks of the greatest masters of the art of chess, such asAlekhine, Capablanca, Tartakower, Lasker, and Bogoljubov. Not since the appearance of the seven-year-oldprodigy Reshevsky at the New York chess tournament of 1922 had the penetration of a complete unknowninto that circle of luminaries caused such a wide sensation. For Czentovic’s intellectual traits certainly didnot seem to promise a dazzling career. It soon emerged that, chess champion or not, in private Czentovicwas unable to write a correctly spelled sentence in any language, and, as one of his irritated peers gibed,“his ignorance was just as absolute in everyother area.”Czentovic’s father, a penniless Yugoslavian Danube bargeman, had been killed in his tiny boat when it wascrushed one night by a grain steamer in a remote area; the twelve-year-old boy had then been taken in bythe local parson out of pity. The good reverend coached him at home, doing his level best to make up forwhat the lumpish, taciturn, broad-browed boy was unable to learn at the village school.But the parson’s efforts were in vain. The letters of the alphabet had been explained to the boy a hundredtimes, yet still he stared at them as though he had never seen them before; no matter how simple thesubject, his brain labored heavily but retained nothing. At the age of fourteen he still counted on his fingers,and, though he was now an adolescent, he could read books and newspapers only with great difficulty. YetMirko could not be called reluctant or willful. He obediently did what was asked, carried water, split wood,helped in the fields, cleaned the kitchen, and reliably (though with annoying slowness) finished any task hewas given.

The letters of the alphabet had been explained to the boy a hundredtimes, yet still he stared at them as though he had never seen them before; no matter how simple thesubject, his brain labored heavily but retained nothing. At the age of fourteen he still counted on his fingers,and, though he was now an adolescent, he could read books and newspapers only with great difficulty. YetMirko could not be called reluctant or willful. He obediently did what was asked, carried water, split wood,helped in the fields, cleaned the kitchen, and reliably (though with annoying slowness) finished any task hewas given. But what irritated the good parson most about the awkward boy was his total apathy. He didnothing unless specifically told to, never asked a question, did not play with other boys, and undertook noactivity that had not been explicitly assigned to him; once Mirko had finished his chores, he sat aroundlistlessly indoors with the vacant look of sheep at pasture, taking not the slightest interest in what went onaround him. While the parson, puffing on his long peasant pipe, played his usual three evening games ofchess with the local constable, the lank-haired blond boy squatted silently beside them and gazed at thecheckered board from beneath his heavy eyelids, seemingly somnolent and indifferent.ON THE great passenger steamer, due to depart New York for Buenos Aires at midnight, there was the usual last-minute bustle and commotion.Visitors from shore shoved confusedly to see their friends off,telegraph boys in cocked caps dashed through the lounges shouting names, trunks and flowers were carriedpast, and inquisitive children ran up and down the companionways, the orchestra playing imperturbably on deck all the while. As I was standing a bit apart from this hubbub, talking on the promenade deck with anacquaintance of mine, two or three flashbulbs flared near us — apparently the press had been quicklyinterviewing and photographing some celebrity just before we sailed. My friend glanced over and smiled.“That’s a rare bird you’ve got on board — that’s Czentovic.” I must have received this news with a ratherblank look, for he went on to explain, “Mirko Czentovic, the world chess champion. He’s crisscrossedAmerica from coast to coast playing tournaments and is now off to Argentina for fresh triumphs.”In fact I now recalled this young world champion and even some details of his meteoric career; my friend, amore assiduous reader of newspapers than I, was able to add a number of anecdotes. About a yearpreviously Czentovic had overnight entered the ranks of the greatest masters of the art of chess, such asAlekhine, Capablanca, Tartakower, Lasker, and Bogoljubov. Not since the appearance of the seven-year-oldprodigy Reshevsky at the New York chess tournament of 1922 had the penetration of a complete unknowninto that circle of luminaries caused such a wide sensation. For Czentovic’s intellectual traits certainly didnot seem to promise a dazzling career.

Not since the appearance of the seven-year-oldprodigy Reshevsky at the New York chess tournament of 1922 had the penetration of a complete unknowninto that circle of luminaries caused such a wide sensation. For Czentovic’s intellectual traits certainly didnot seem to promise a dazzling career. It soon emerged that, chess champion or not, in private Czentovicwas unable to write a correctly spelled sentence in any language, and, as one of his irritated peers gibed,“his ignorance was just as absolute in everyother area.”Czentovic’s father, a penniless Yugoslavian Danube bargeman, had been killed in his tiny boat when it wascrushed one night by a grain steamer in a remote area; the twelve-year-old boy had then been taken in bythe local parson out of pity. The good reverend coached him at home, doing his level best to make up forwhat the lumpish, taciturn, broad-browed boy was unable to learn at the village school.But the parson’s efforts were in vain. The letters of the alphabet had been explained to the boy a hundredtimes, yet still he stared at them as though he had never seen them before; no matter how simple thesubject, his brain labored heavily but retained nothing. At the age of fourteen he still counted on his fingers,and, though he was now an adolescent, he could read books and newspapers only with great difficulty. YetMirko could not be called reluctant or willful. He obediently did what was asked, carried water, split wood,helped in the fields, cleaned the kitchen, and reliably (though with annoying slowness) finished any task hewas given. But what irritated the good parson most about the awkward boy was his total apathy. He didnothing unless specifically told to, never asked a question, did not play with other boys, and undertook noactivity that had not been explicitly assigned to him; once Mirko had finished his chores, he sat aroundlistlessly indoors with the vacant look of sheep at pasture, taking not the slightest interest in what went onaround him. While the parson, puffing on his long peasant pipe, played his usual three evening games ofchess with the local constable, the lank-haired blond boy squatted silently beside them and gazed at thecheckered board from beneath his heavy eyelids, seemingly somnolent and indifferent.ON THE great passenger steamer, due to depart New York for Buenos Aires at midnight, there was the usual last-minute bustle and commotion.Visitors from shore shoved confusedly to see their friends off,telegraph boys in cocked caps dashed through the lounges shouting names, trunks and flowers were carriedpast, and inquisitive children ran up and down the companionways, the orchestra playing imperturbably on deck all the while. As I was standing a bit apart from this hubbub, talking on the promenade deck with anacquaintance of mine, two or three flashbulbs flared near us — apparently the press had been quicklyinterviewing and photographing some celebrity just before we sailed. My friend glanced over and smiled.“That’s a rare bird you’ve got on board — that’s Czentovic.” I must have received this news with a ratherblank look, for he went on to explain, “Mirko Czentovic, the world chess champion.

My friend glanced over and smiled.“That’s a rare bird you’ve got on board — that’s Czentovic.” I must have received this news with a ratherblank look, for he went on to explain, “Mirko Czentovic, the world chess champion. He’s crisscrossedAmerica from coast to coast playing tournaments and is now off to Argentina for fresh triumphs.”In fact I now recalled this young world champion and even some details of his meteoric career; my friend, amore assiduous reader of newspapers than I, was able to add a number of anecdotes. About a yearpreviously Czentovic had overnight entered the ranks of the greatest masters of the art of chess, such asAlekhine, Capablanca, Tartakower, Lasker, and Bogoljubov. Not since the appearance of the seven-year-oldprodigy Reshevsky at the New York chess tournament of 1922 had the penetration of a complete unknowninto that circle of luminaries caused such a wide sensation. For Czentovic’s intellectual traits certainly didnot seem to promise a dazzling career. It soon emerged that, chess champion or not, in private Czentovicwas unable to write a correctly spelled sentence in any language, and, as one of his irritated peers gibed,“his ignorance was just as absolute in everyother area.”Czentovic’s father, a penniless Yugoslavian Danube bargeman, had been killed in his tiny boat when it wascrushed one night by a grain steamer in a remote area; the twelve-year-old boy had then been taken in bythe local parson out of pity. The good reverend coached him at home, doing his level best to make up forwhat the lumpish, taciturn, broad-browed boy was unable to learn at the village school.But the parson’s efforts were in vain. The letters of the alphabet had been explained to the boy a hundredtimes, yet still he stared at them as though he had never seen them before; no matter how simple thesubject, his brain labored heavily but retained nothing. At the age of fourteen he still counted on his fingers,and, though he was now an adolescent, he could read books and newspapers only with great difficulty. YetMirko could not be called reluctant or willful. He obediently did what was asked, carried water, split wood,helped in the fields, cleaned the kitchen, and reliably (though with annoying slowness) finished any task hewas given. But what irritated the good parson most about the awkward boy was his total apathy. He didnothing unless specifically told to, never asked a question, did not play with other boys, and undertook noactivity that had not been explicitly assigned to him; once Mirko had finished his chores, he sat aroundlistlessly indoors with the vacant look of sheep at pasture, taking not the slightest interest in what went onaround him.

He didnothing unless specifically told to, never asked a question, did not play with other boys, and undertook noactivity that had not been explicitly assigned to him; once Mirko had finished his chores, he sat aroundlistlessly indoors with the vacant look of sheep at pasture, taking not the slightest interest in what went onaround him. While the parson, puffing on his long peasant pipe, played his usual three evening games ofchess with the local constable, the lank-haired blond boy squatted silently beside them and gazed at thecheckered board from beneath his heavy eyelids, seemingly somnolent and indifferent.ON THE great passenger steamer, due to depart New York for Buenos Aires at midnight, there was the usual last-minute bustle and commotion.Visitors from shore shoved confusedly to see their friends off,telegraph boys in cocked caps dashed through the lounges shouting names, trunks and flowers were carriedpast, and inquisitive children ran up and down the companionways, the orchestra playing imperturbably on deck all the while. As I was standing a bit apart from this hubbub, talking on the promenade deck with anacquaintance of mine, two or three flashbulbs flared near us — apparently the press had been quicklyinterviewing and photographing some celebrity just before we sailed. My friend glanced over and smiled.“That’s a rare bird you’ve got on board — that’s Czentovic.” I must have received this news with a ratherblank look, for he went on to explain, “Mirko Czentovic, the world chess champion. He’s crisscrossedAmerica from coast to coast playing tournaments and is now off to Argentina for fresh triumphs.”In fact I now recalled this young world champion and even some details of his meteoric career; my friend, amore assiduous reader of newspapers than I, was able to add a number of anecdotes. About a yearpreviously Czentovic had overnight entered the ranks of the greatest masters of the art of chess, such asAlekhine, Capablanca, Tartakower, Lasker, and Bogoljubov. Not since the appearance of the seven-year-oldprodigy Reshevsky at the New York chess tournament of 1922 had the penetration of a complete unknowninto that circle of luminaries caused such a wide sensation. For Czentovic’s intellectual traits certainly didnot seem to promise a dazzling career. It soon emerged that, chess champion or not, in private Czentovicwas unable to write a correctly spelled sentence in any language, and, as one of his irritated peers gibed,“his ignorance was just as absolute in everyother area.”Czentovic’s father, a penniless Yugoslavian Danube bargeman, had been killed in his tiny boat when it wascrushed one night by a grain steamer in a remote area; the twelve-year-old boy had then been taken in bythe local parson out of pity. The good reverend coached him at home, doing his level best to make up forwhat the lumpish, taciturn, broad-browed boy was unable to learn at the village school.But the parson’s efforts were in vain. The letters of the alphabet had been explained to the boy a hundredtimes, yet still he stared at them as though he had never seen them before; no matter how simple thesubject, his brain labored heavily but retained nothing. At the age of fourteen he still counted on his fingers,and, though he was now an adolescent, he could read books and newspapers only with great difficulty. YetMirko could not be called reluctant or willful. He obediently did what was asked, carried water, split wood,helped in the fields, cleaned the kitchen, and reliably (though with annoying slowness) finished any task hewas given.

The letters of the alphabet had been explained to the boy a hundredtimes, yet still he stared at them as though he had never seen them before; no matter how simple thesubject, his brain labored heavily but retained nothing. At the age of fourteen he still counted on his fingers,and, though he was now an adolescent, he could read books and newspapers only with great difficulty. YetMirko could not be called reluctant or willful. He obediently did what was asked, carried water, split wood,helped in the fields, cleaned the kitchen, and reliably (though with annoying slowness) finished any task hewas given. But what irritated the good parson most about the awkward boy was his total apathy. He didnothing unless specifically told to, never asked a question, did not play with other boys, and undertook noactivity that had not been explicitly assigned to him; once Mirko had finished his chores, he sat aroundlistlessly indoors with the vacant look of sheep at pasture, taking not the slightest interest in what went onaround him. While the parson, puffing on his long peasant pipe, played his usual three evening games ofchess with the local constable, the lank-haired blond boy squatted silently beside them and gazed at thecheckered board from beneath his heavy eyelids, seemingly somnolent and indifferent.ON THE great passenger steamer, due to depart New York for Buenos Aires at midnight, there was the usual last-minute bustle and commotion.Visitors from shore shoved confusedly to see their friends off,telegraph boys in cocked caps dashed through the lounges shouting names, trunks and flowers were carriedpast, and inquisitive children ran up and down the companionways, the orchestra playing imperturbably on deck all the while. As I was standing a bit apart from this hubbub, talking on the promenade deck with anacquaintance of mine, two or three flashbulbs flared near us — apparently the press had been quicklyinterviewing and photographing some celebrity just before we sailed. My friend glanced over and smiled.“That’s a rare bird you’ve got on board — that’s Czentovic.” I must have received this news with a ratherblank look, for he went on to explain, “Mirko Czentovic, the world chess champion. He’s crisscrossedAmerica from coast to coast playing tournaments and is now off to Argentina for fresh triumphs.”In fact I now recalled this young world champion and even some details of his meteoric career; my friend, amore assiduous reader of newspapers than I, was able to add a number of anecdotes. About a yearpreviously Czentovic had overnight entered the ranks of the greatest masters of the art of chess, such asAlekhine, Capablanca, Tartakower, Lasker, and Bogoljubov. Not since the appearance of the seven-year-oldprodigy Reshevsky at the New York chess tournament of 1922 had the penetration of a complete unknowninto that circle of luminaries caused such a wide sensation. For Czentovic’s intellectual traits certainly didnot seem to promise a dazzling career.

Not since the appearance of the seven-year-oldprodigy Reshevsky at the New York chess tournament of 1922 had the penetration of a complete unknowninto that circle of luminaries caused such a wide sensation. For Czentovic’s intellectual traits certainly didnot seem to promise a dazzling career. It soon emerged that, chess champion or not, in private Czentovicwas unable to write a correctly spelled sentence in any language, and, as one of his irritated peers gibed,“his ignorance was just as absolute in everyother area.”Czentovic’s father, a penniless Yugoslavian Danube bargeman, had been killed in his tiny boat when it wascrushed one night by a grain steamer in a remote area; the twelve-year-old boy had then been taken in bythe local parson out of pity. The good reverend coached him at home, doing his level best to make up forwhat the lumpish, taciturn, broad-browed boy was unable to learn at the village school.But the parson’s efforts were in vain. The letters of the alphabet had been explained to the boy a hundredtimes, yet still he stared at them as though he had never seen them before; no matter how simple thesubject, his brain labored heavily but retained nothing. At the age of fourteen he still counted on his fingers,and, though he was now an adolescent, he could read books and newspapers only with great difficulty. YetMirko could not be called reluctant or willful. He obediently did what was asked, carried water, split wood,helped in the fields, cleaned the kitchen, and reliably (though with annoying slowness) finished any task hewas given. But what irritated the good parson most about the awkward boy was his total apathy. He didnothing unless specifically told to, never asked a question, did not play with other boys, and undertook noactivity that had not been explicitly assigned to him; once Mirko had finished his chores, he sat aroundlistlessly indoors with the vacant look of sheep at pasture, taking not the slightest interest in what went onaround him. While the parson, puffing on his long peasant pipe, played his usual three evening games ofchess with the local constable, the lank-haired blond boy squatted silently beside them and gazed at thecheckered board from beneath his heavy eyelids, seemingly somnolent and indifferent.ON THE great passenger steamer, due to depart New York for Buenos Aires at midnight, there was the usual last-minute bustle and commotion.Visitors from shore shoved confusedly to see their friends off,telegraph boys in cocked caps dashed through the lounges shouting names, trunks and flowers were carriedpast, and inquisitive children ran up and down the companionways, the orchestra playing imperturbably on deck all the while. As I was standing a bit apart from this hubbub, talking on the promenade deck with anacquaintance of mine, two or three flashbulbs flared near us — apparently the press had been quicklyinterviewing and photographing some celebrity just before we sailed. My friend glanced over and smiled.“That’s a rare bird you’ve got on board — that’s Czentovic.” I must have received this news with a ratherblank look, for he went on to explain, “Mirko Czentovic, the world chess champion.

My friend glanced over and smiled.“That’s a rare bird you’ve got on board — that’s Czentovic.” I must have received this news with a ratherblank look, for he went on to explain, “Mirko Czentovic, the world chess champion. He’s crisscrossedAmerica from coast to coast playing tournaments and is now off to Argentina for fresh triumphs.”In fact I now recalled this young world champion and even some details of his meteoric career; my friend, amore assiduous reader of newspapers than I, was able to add a number of anecdotes. About a yearpreviously Czentovic had overnight entered the ranks of the greatest masters of the art of chess, such asAlekhine, Capablanca, Tartakower, Lasker, and Bogoljubov. Not since the appearance of the seven-year-oldprodigy Reshevsky at the New York chess tournament of 1922 had the penetration of a complete unknowninto that circle of luminaries caused such a wide sensation. For Czentovic’s intellectual traits certainly didnot seem to promise a dazzling career. It soon emerged that, chess champion or not, in private Czentovicwas unable to write a correctly spelled sentence in any language, and, as one of his irritated peers gibed,“his ignorance was just as absolute in everyother area.”Czentovic’s father, a penniless Yugoslavian Danube bargeman, had been killed in his tiny boat when it wascrushed one night by a grain steamer in a remote area; the twelve-year-old boy had then been taken in bythe local parson out of pity. The good reverend coached him at home, doing his level best to make up forwhat the lumpish, taciturn, broad-browed boy was unable to learn at the village school.But the parson’s efforts were in vain. The letters of the alphabet had been explained to the boy a hundredtimes, yet still he stared at them as though he had never seen them before; no matter how simple thesubject, his brain labored heavily but retained nothing. At the age of fourteen he still counted on his fingers,and, though he was now an adolescent, he could read books and newspapers only with great difficulty. YetMirko could not be called reluctant or willful. He obediently did what was asked, carried water, split wood,helped in the fields, cleaned the kitchen, and reliably (though with annoying slowness) finished any task hewas given. But what irritated the good parson most about the awkward boy was his total apathy. He didnothing unless specifically told to, never asked a question, did not play with other boys, and undertook noactivity that had not been explicitly assigned to him; once Mirko had finished his chores, he sat aroundlistlessly indoors with the vacant look of sheep at pasture, taking not the slightest interest in what went onaround him.

He didnothing unless specifically told to, never asked a question, did not play with other boys, and undertook noactivity that had not been explicitly assigned to him; once Mirko had finished his chores, he sat aroundlistlessly indoors with the vacant look of sheep at pasture, taking not the slightest interest in what went onaround him. While the parson, puffing on his long peasant pipe, played his usual three evening games ofchess with the local constable, the lank-haired blond boy squatted silently beside them and gazed at thecheckered board from beneath his heavy eyelids, seemingly somnolent and indifferent.ON THE great passenger steamer, due to depart New York for Buenos Aires at midnight, there was the usual last-minute bustle and commotion.Visitors from shore shoved confusedly to see their friends off,telegraph boys in cocked caps dashed through the lounges shouting names, trunks and flowers were carriedpast, and inquisitive children ran up and down the companionways, the orchestra playing imperturbably on deck all the while. As I was standing a bit apart from this hubbub, talking on the promenade deck with anacquaintance of mine, two or three flashbulbs flared near us — apparently the press had been quicklyinterviewing and photographing some celebrity just before we sailed. My friend glanced over and smiled.“That’s a rare bird you’ve got on board — that’s Czentovic.” I must have received this news with a ratherblank look, for he went on to explain, “Mirko Czentovic, the world chess champion. He’s crisscrossedAmerica from coast to coast playing tournaments and is now off to Argentina for fresh triumphs.”In fact I now recalled this young world champion and even some details of his meteoric career; my friend, amore assiduous reader of newspapers than I, was able to add a number of anecdotes. About a yearpreviously Czentovic had overnight entered the ranks of the greatest masters of the art of chess, such asAlekhine, Capablanca, Tartakower, Lasker, and Bogoljubov. Not since the appearance of the seven-year-oldprodigy Reshevsky at the New York chess tournament of 1922 had the penetration of a complete unknowninto that circle of luminaries caused such a wide sensation. For Czentovic’s intellectual traits certainly didnot seem to promise a dazzling career. It soon emerged that, chess champion or not, in private Czentovicwas unable to write a correctly spelled sentence in any language, and, as one of his irritated peers gibed,“his ignorance was just as absolute in everyother area.”Czentovic’s father, a penniless Yugoslavian Danube bargeman, had been killed in his tiny boat when it wascrushed one night by a grain steamer in a remote area; the twelve-year-old boy had then been taken in bythe local parson out of pity. The good reverend coached him at home, doing his level best to make up forwhat the lumpish, taciturn, broad-browed boy was unable to learn at the village school.But the parson’s efforts were in vain. The letters of the alphabet had been explained to the boy a hundredtimes, yet still he stared at them as though he had never seen them before; no matter how simple thesubject, his brain labored heavily but retained nothing. At the age of fourteen he still counted on his fingers,and, though he was now an adolescent, he could read books and newspapers only with great difficulty. YetMirko could not be called reluctant or willful. He obediently did what was asked, carried water, split wood,helped in the fields, cleaned the kitchen, and reliably (though with annoying slowness) finished any task hewas given.

The letters of the alphabet had been explained to the boy a hundredtimes, yet still he stared at them as though he had never seen them before; no matter how simple thesubject, his brain labored heavily but retained nothing. At the age of fourteen he still counted on his fingers,and, though he was now an adolescent, he could read books and newspapers only with great difficulty. YetMirko could not be called reluctant or willful. He obediently did what was asked, carried water, split wood,helped in the fields, cleaned the kitchen, and reliably (though with annoying slowness) finished any task hewas given. But what irritated the good parson most about the awkward boy was his total apathy. He didnothing unless specifically told to, never asked a question, did not play with other boys, and undertook noactivity that had not been explicitly assigned to him; once Mirko had finished his chores, he sat aroundlistlessly indoors with the vacant look of sheep at pasture, taking not the slightest interest in what went onaround him. While the parson, puffing on his long peasant pipe, played his usual three evening games ofchess with the local constable, the lank-haired blond boy squatted silently beside them and gazed at thecheckered board from beneath his heavy eyelids, seemingly somnolent and indifferent.ON THE great passenger steamer, due to depart New York for Buenos Aires at midnight, there was the usual last-minute bustle and commotion.Visitors from shore shoved confusedly to see their friends off,telegraph boys in cocked caps dashed through the lounges shouting names, trunks and flowers were carriedpast, and inquisitive children ran up and down the companionways, the orchestra playing imperturbably on deck all the while. As I was standing a bit apart from this hubbub, talking on the promenade deck with anacquaintance of mine, two or three flashbulbs flared near us — apparently the press had been quicklyinterviewing and photographing some celebrity just before we sailed. My friend glanced over and smiled.“That’s a rare bird you’ve got on board — that’s Czentovic.” I must have received this news with a ratherblank look, for he went on to explain, “Mirko Czentovic, the world chess champion. He’s crisscrossedAmerica from coast to coast playing tournaments and is now off to Argentina for fresh triumphs.”In fact I now recalled this young world champion and even some details of his meteoric career; my friend, amore assiduous reader of newspapers than I, was able to add a number of anecdotes. About a yearpreviously Czentovic had overnight entered the ranks of the greatest masters of the art of chess, such asAlekhine, Capablanca, Tartakower, Lasker, and Bogoljubov. Not since the appearance of the seven-year-oldprodigy Reshevsky at the New York chess tournament of 1922 had the penetration of a complete unknowninto that circle of luminaries caused such a wide sensation. For Czentovic’s intellectual traits certainly didnot seem to promise a dazzling career.

Not since the appearance of the seven-year-oldprodigy Reshevsky at the New York chess tournament of 1922 had the penetration of a complete unknowninto that circle of luminaries caused such a wide sensation. For Czentovic’s intellectual traits certainly didnot seem to promise a dazzling career. It soon emerged that, chess champion or not, in private Czentovicwas unable to write a correctly spelled sentence in any language, and, as one of his irritated peers gibed,“his ignorance was just as absolute in everyother area.”Czentovic’s father, a penniless Yugoslavian Danube bargeman, had been killed in his tiny boat when it wascrushed one night by a grain steamer in a remote area; the twelve-year-old boy had then been taken in bythe local parson out of pity. The good reverend coached him at home, doing his level best to make up forwhat the lumpish, taciturn, broad-browed boy was unable to learn at the village school.But the parson’s efforts were in vain. The letters of the alphabet had been explained to the boy a hundredtimes, yet still he stared at them as though he had never seen them before; no matter how simple thesubject, his brain labored heavily but retained nothing. At the age of fourteen he still counted on his fingers,and, though he was now an adolescent, he could read books and newspapers only with great difficulty. YetMirko could not be called reluctant or willful. He obediently did what was asked, carried water, split wood,helped in the fields, cleaned the kitchen, and reliably (though with annoying slowness) finished any task hewas given. But what irritated the good parson most about the awkward boy was his total apathy. He didnothing unless specifically told to, never asked a question, did not play with other boys, and undertook noactivity that had not been explicitly assigned to him; once Mirko had finished his chores, he sat aroundlistlessly indoors with the vacant look of sheep at pasture, taking not the slightest interest in what went onaround him. While the parson, puffing on his long peasant pipe, played his usual three evening games ofchess with the local constable, the lank-haired blond boy squatted silently beside them and gazed at thecheckered board from beneath his heavy eyelids, seemingly somnolent and indifferent.ON THE great passenger steamer, due to depart New York for Buenos Aires at midnight, there was the usual last-minute bustle and commotion.Visitors from shore shoved confusedly to see their friends off,telegraph boys in cocked caps dashed through the lounges shouting names, trunks and flowers were carriedpast, and inquisitive children ran up and down the companionways, the orchestra playing imperturbably on deck all the while. As I was standing a bit apart from this hubbub, talking on the promenade deck with anacquaintance of mine, two or three flashbulbs flared near us — apparently the press had been quicklyinterviewing and photographing some celebrity just before we sailed. My friend glanced over and smiled.“That’s a rare bird you’ve got on board — that’s Czentovic.” I must have received this news with a ratherblank look, for he went on to explain, “Mirko Czentovic, the world chess champion.

My friend glanced over and smiled.“That’s a rare bird you’ve got on board — that’s Czentovic.” I must have received this news with a ratherblank look, for he went on to explain, “Mirko Czentovic, the world chess champion. He’s crisscrossedAmerica from coast to coast playing tournaments and is now off to Argentina for fresh triumphs.”In fact I now recalled this young world champion and even some details of his meteoric career; my friend, amore assiduous reader of newspapers than I, was able to add a number of anecdotes. About a yearpreviously Czentovic had overnight entered the ranks of the greatest masters of the art of chess, such asAlekhine, Capablanca, Tartakower, Lasker, and Bogoljubov. Not since the appearance of the seven-year-oldprodigy Reshevsky at the New York chess tournament of 1922 had the penetration of a complete unknowninto that circle of luminaries caused such a wide sensation. For Czentovic’s intellectual traits certainly didnot seem to promise a dazzling career. It soon emerged that, chess champion or not, in private Czentovicwas unable to write a correctly spelled sentence in any language, and, as one of his irritated peers gibed,“his ignorance was just as absolute in everyother area.”Czentovic’s father, a penniless Yugoslavian Danube bargeman, had been killed in his tiny boat when it wascrushed one night by a grain steamer in a remote area; the twelve-year-old boy had then been taken in bythe local parson out of pity. The good reverend coached him at home, doing his level best to make up forwhat the lumpish, taciturn, broad-browed boy was unable to learn at the village school.But the parson’s efforts were in vain. The letters of the alphabet had been explained to the boy a hundredtimes, yet still he stared at them as though he had never seen them before; no matter how simple thesubject, his brain labored heavily but retained nothing. At the age of fourteen he still counted on his fingers,and, though he was now an adolescent, he could read books and newspapers only with great difficulty. YetMirko could not be called reluctant or willful. He obediently did what was asked, carried water, split wood,helped in the fields, cleaned the kitchen, and reliably (though with annoying slowness) finished any task hewas given. But what irritated the good parson most about the awkward boy was his total apathy. He didnothing unless specifically told to, never asked a question, did not play with other boys, and undertook noactivity that had not been explicitly assigned to him; once Mirko had finished his chores, he sat aroundlistlessly indoors with the vacant look of sheep at pasture, taking not the slightest interest in what went onaround him.

He didnothing unless specifically told to, never asked a question, did not play with other boys, and undertook noactivity that had not been explicitly assigned to him; once Mirko had finished his chores, he sat aroundlistlessly indoors with the vacant look of sheep at pasture, taking not the slightest interest in what went onaround him. While the parson, puffing on his long peasant pipe, played his usual three evening games ofchess with the local constable, the lank-haired blond boy squatted silently beside them and gazed at thecheckered board from beneath his heavy eyelids, seemingly somnolent and indifferent.ON THE great passenger steamer, due to depart New York for Buenos Aires at midnight, there was the usual last-minute bustle and commotion.Visitors from shore shoved confusedly to see their friends off,telegraph boys in cocked caps dashed through the lounges shouting names, trunks and flowers were carriedpast, and inquisitive children ran up and down the companionways, the orchestra playing imperturbably on deck all the while. As I was standing a bit apart from this hubbub, talking on the promenade deck with anacquaintance of mine, two or three flashbulbs flared near us — apparently the press had been quicklyinterviewing and photographing some celebrity just before we sailed. My friend glanced over and smiled.“That’s a rare bird you’ve got on board — that’s Czentovic.” I must have received this news with a ratherblank look, for he went on to explain, “Mirko Czentovic, the world chess champion. He’s crisscrossedAmerica from coast to coast playing tournaments and is now off to Argentina for fresh triumphs.”In fact I now recalled this young world champion and even some details of his meteoric career; my friend, amore assiduous reader of newspapers than I, was able to add a number of anecdotes. About a yearpreviously Czentovic had overnight entered the ranks of the greatest masters of the art of chess, such asAlekhine, Capablanca, Tartakower, Lasker, and Bogoljubov. Not since the appearance of the seven-year-oldprodigy Reshevsky at the New York chess tournament of 1922 had the penetration of a complete unknowninto that circle of luminaries caused such a wide sensation. For Czentovic’s intellectual traits certainly didnot seem to promise a dazzling career. It soon emerged that, chess champion or not, in private Czentovicwas unable to write a correctly spelled sentence in any language, and, as one of his irritated peers gibed,“his ignorance was just as absolute in everyother area.”Czentovic’s father, a penniless Yugoslavian Danube bargeman, had been killed in his tiny boat when it wascrushed one night by a grain steamer in a remote area; the twelve-year-old boy had then been taken in bythe local parson out of pity. The good reverend coached him at home, doing his level best to make up forwhat the lumpish, taciturn, broad-browed boy was unable to learn at the village school.But the parson’s efforts were in vain. The letters of the alphabet had been explained to the boy a hundredtimes, yet still he stared at them as though he had never seen them before; no matter how simple thesubject, his brain labored heavily but retained nothing. At the age of fourteen he still counted on his fingers,and, though he was now an adolescent, he could read books and newspapers only with great difficulty. YetMirko could not be called reluctant or willful. He obediently did what was asked, carried water, split wood,helped in the fields, cleaned the kitchen, and reliably (though with annoying slowness) finished any task hewas given.

The letters of the alphabet had been explained to the boy a hundredtimes, yet still he stared at them as though he had never seen them before; no matter how simple thesubject, his brain labored heavily but retained nothing. At the age of fourteen he still counted on his fingers,and, though he was now an adolescent, he could read books and newspapers only with great difficulty. YetMirko could not be called reluctant or willful. He obediently did what was asked, carried water, split wood,helped in the fields, cleaned the kitchen, and reliably (though with annoying slowness) finished any task hewas given. But what irritated the good parson most about the awkward boy was his total apathy. He didnothing unless specifically told to, never asked a question, did not play with other boys, and undertook noactivity that had not been explicitly assigned to him; once Mirko had finished his chores, he sat aroundlistlessly indoors with the vacant look of sheep at pasture, taking not the slightest interest in what went onaround him. While the parson, puffing on his long peasant pipe, played his usual three evening games ofchess with the local constable, the lank-haired blond boy squatted silently beside them and gazed at thecheckered board from beneath his heavy eyelids, seemingly somnolent and indifferent.ON THE great passenger steamer, due to depart New York for Buenos Aires at midnight, there was the usual last-minute bustle and commotion.Visitors from shore shoved confusedly to see their friends off,telegraph boys in cocked caps dashed through the lounges shouting names, trunks and flowers were carriedpast, and inquisitive children ran up and down the companionways, the orchestra playing imperturbably on deck all the while. As I was standing a bit apart from this hubbub, talking on the promenade deck with anacquaintance of mine, two or three flashbulbs flared near us — apparently the press had been quicklyinterviewing and photographing some celebrity just before we sailed. My friend glanced over and smiled.“That’s a rare bird you’ve got on board — that’s Czentovic.” I must have received this news with a ratherblank look, for he went on to explain, “Mirko Czentovic, the world chess champion. He’s crisscrossedAmerica from coast to coast playing tournaments and is now off to Argentina for fresh triumphs.”In fact I now recalled this young world champion and even some details of his meteoric career; my friend, amore assiduous reader of newspapers than I, was able to add a number of anecdotes. About a yearpreviously Czentovic had overnight entered the ranks of the greatest masters of the art of chess, such asAlekhine, Capablanca, Tartakower, Lasker, and Bogoljubov. Not since the appearance of the seven-year-oldprodigy Reshevsky at the New York chess tournament of 1922 had the penetration of a complete unknowninto that circle of luminaries caused such a wide sensation. For Czentovic’s intellectual traits certainly didnot seem to promise a dazzling career.

Not since the appearance of the seven-year-oldprodigy Reshevsky at the New York chess tournament of 1922 had the penetration of a complete unknowninto that circle of luminaries caused such a wide sensation. For Czentovic’s intellectual traits certainly didnot seem to promise a dazzling career. It soon emerged that, chess champion or not, in private Czentovicwas unable to write a correctly spelled sentence in any language, and, as one of his irritated peers gibed,“his ignorance was just as absolute in everyother area.”Czentovic’s father, a penniless Yugoslavian Danube bargeman, had been killed in his tiny boat when it wascrushed one night by a grain steamer in a remote area; the twelve-year-old boy had then been taken in bythe local parson out of pity. The good reverend coached him at home, doing his level best to make up forwhat the lumpish, taciturn, broad-browed boy was unable to learn at the village school.But the parson’s efforts were in vain. The letters of the alphabet had been explained to the boy a hundredtimes, yet still he stared at them as though he had never seen them before; no matter how simple thesubject, his brain labored heavily but retained nothing. At the age of fourteen he still counted on his fingers,and, though he was now an adolescent, he could read books and newspapers only with great difficulty. YetMirko could not be called reluctant or willful. He obediently did what was asked, carried water, split wood,helped in the fields, cleaned the kitchen, and reliably (though with annoying slowness) finished any task hewas given. But what irritated the good parson most about the awkward boy was his total apathy. He didnothing unless specifically told to, never asked a question, did not play with other boys, and undertook noactivity that had not been explicitly assigned to him; once Mirko had finished his chores, he sat aroundlistlessly indoors with the vacant look of sheep at pasture, taking not the slightest interest in what went onaround him. While the parson, puffing on his long peasant pipe, played his usual three evening games ofchess with the local constable, the lank-haired blond boy squatted silently beside them and gazed at thecheckered board from beneath his heavy eyelids, seemingly somnolent and indifferent.ON THE great passenger steamer, due to depart New York for Buenos Aires at midnight, there was the usual last-minute bustle and commotion.Visitors from shore shoved confusedly to see their friends off,telegraph boys in cocked caps dashed through the lounges shouting names, trunks and flowers were carriedpast, and inquisitive children ran up and down the companionways, the orchestra playing imperturbably on deck all the while. As I was standing a bit apart from this hubbub, talking on the promenade deck with anacquaintance of mine, two or three flashbulbs flared near us — apparently the press had been quicklyinterviewing and photographing some celebrity just before we sailed. My friend glanced over and smiled.“That’s a rare bird you’ve got on board — that’s Czentovic.” I must have received this news with a ratherblank look, for he went on to explain, “Mirko Czentovic, the world chess champion.

My friend glanced over and smiled.“That’s a rare bird you’ve got on board — that’s Czentovic.” I must have received this news with a ratherblank look, for he went on to explain, “Mirko Czentovic, the world chess champion. He’s crisscrossedAmerica from coast to coast playing tournaments and is now off to Argentina for fresh triumphs.”In fact I now recalled this young world champion and even some details of his meteoric career; my friend, amore assiduous reader of newspapers than I, was able to add a number of anecdotes. About a yearpreviously Czentovic had overnight entered the ranks of the greatest masters of the art of chess, such asAlekhine, Capablanca, Tartakower, Lasker, and Bogoljubov. Not since the appearance of the seven-year-oldprodigy Reshevsky at the New York chess tournament of 1922 had the penetration of a complete unknowninto that circle of luminaries caused such a wide sensation. For Czentovic’s intellectual traits certainly didnot seem to promise a dazzling career. It soon emerged that, chess champion or not, in private Czentovicwas unable to write a correctly spelled sentence in any language, and, as one of his irritated peers gibed,“his ignorance was just as absolute in everyother area.”Czentovic’s father, a penniless Yugoslavian Danube bargeman, had been killed in his tiny boat when it wascrushed one night by a grain steamer in a remote area; the twelve-year-old boy had then been taken in bythe local parson out of pity. The good reverend coached him at home, doing his level best to make up forwhat the lumpish, taciturn, broad-browed boy was unable to learn at the village school.But the parson’s efforts were in vain. The letters of the alphabet had been explained to the boy a hundredtimes, yet still he stared at them as though he had never seen them before; no matter how simple thesubject, his brain labored heavily but retained nothing. At the age of fourteen he still counted on his fingers,and, though he was now an adolescent, he could read books and newspapers only with great difficulty. YetMirko could not be called reluctant or willful. He obediently did what was asked, carried water, split wood,helped in the fields, cleaned the kitchen, and reliably (though with annoying slowness) finished any task hewas given. But what irritated the good parson most about the awkward boy was his total apathy. He didnothing unless specifically told to, never asked a question, did not play with other boys, and undertook noactivity that had not been explicitly assigned to him; once Mirko had finished his chores, he sat aroundlistlessly indoors with the vacant look of sheep at pasture, taking not the slightest interest in what went onaround him.

He didnothing unless specifically told to, never asked a question, did not play with other boys, and undertook noactivity that had not been explicitly assigned to him; once Mirko had finished his chores, he sat aroundlistlessly indoors with the vacant look of sheep at pasture, taking not the slightest interest in what went onaround him. While the parson, puffing on his long peasant pipe, played his usual three evening games ofchess with the local constable, the lank-haired blond boy squatted silently beside them and gazed at thecheckered board from beneath his heavy eyelids, seemingly somnolent and indifferent.ON THE great passenger steamer, due to depart New York for Buenos Aires at midnight, there was the usual last-minute bustle and commotion.Visitors from shore shoved confusedly to see their friends off,telegraph boys in cocked caps dashed through the lounges shouting names, trunks and flowers were carriedpast, and inquisitive children ran up and down the companionways, the orchestra playing imperturbably on deck all the while. As I was standing a bit apart from this hubbub, talking on the promenade deck with anacquaintance of mine, two or three flashbulbs flared near us — apparently the press had been quicklyinterviewing and photographing some celebrity just before we sailed. My friend glanced over and smiled.“That’s a rare bird you’ve got on board — that’s Czentovic.” I must have received this news with a ratherblank look, for he went on to explain, “Mirko Czentovic, the world chess champion. He’s crisscrossedAmerica from coast to coast playing tournaments and is now off to Argentina for fresh triumphs.”In fact I now recalled this young world champion and even some details of his meteoric career; my friend, amore assiduous reader of newspapers than I, was able to add a number of anecdotes. About a yearpreviously Czentovic had overnight entered the ranks of the greatest masters of the art of chess, such asAlekhine, Capablanca, Tartakower, Lasker, and Bogoljubov. Not since the appearance of the seven-year-oldprodigy Reshevsky at the New York chess tournament of 1922 had the penetration of a complete unknowninto that circle of luminaries caused such a wide sensation. For Czentovic’s intellectual traits certainly didnot seem to promise a dazzling career. It soon emerged that, chess champion or not, in private Czentovicwas unable to write a correctly spelled sentence in any language, and, as one of his irritated peers gibed,“his ignorance was just as absolute in everyother area.”Czentovic’s father, a penniless Yugoslavian Danube bargeman, had been killed in his tiny boat when it wascrushed one night by a grain steamer in a remote area; the twelve-year-old boy had then been taken in bythe local parson out of pity. The good reverend coached him at home, doing his level best to make up forwhat the lumpish, taciturn, broad-browed boy was unable to learn at the village school.But the parson’s efforts were in vain. The letters of the alphabet had been explained to the boy a hundredtimes, yet still he stared at them as though he had never seen them before; no matter how simple thesubject, his brain labored heavily but retained nothing. At the age of fourteen he still counted on his fingers,and, though he was now an adolescent, he could read books and newspapers only with great difficulty. YetMirko could not be called reluctant or willful.
